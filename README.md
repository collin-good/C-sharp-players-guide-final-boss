# Background
This project is the final challenge from the book "The C# Players Guide" by RB Whitaker that teaches the reader the basics of object-oriented programming and coding in C# with a narrative that the reader (the true programmer) is helping people in a land that lost it's ability to write code becuase of the dreaded "Uncoded One". It is a turn based battle game (a la Pokemon) that sees The True Programmer and Vin Fletcher (one of the characters from the book) fighting through The Uncoded One's forces; leading to the final showdown with him.

# Skills Showcased
This project showcases my ability to write object oriented code using concepts such as abstraction (CharacterActions are all used with their Perform method) and polymorphism (character controllers and items are able to be substituted for each other without changing the code), as well as basic C# concepts such as methods interfaces, and events
